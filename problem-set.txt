The job scheduling problem is a well-known problem in computer science and operations research. 
The problem involves scheduling a set of jobs containing deadline and profits from it in such a way as to minimize the total completion time on deadline. 
The problem is usually formulated as follows:

Given a set of jobs J = {'job_id',deadline,profit}, where each job j has a deadline and a profit, 
The goal is to find a sequence of jobs which will maximize the profit.
